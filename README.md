![Bikes](divvy_1.jpg)

GitHub project created 6 July 2021

### Description
Development of a Python program that provides Bike Share statistics and reporting
in the following areas:

Category | Description
-------- | -----------
Usage Times | Number of trips by time of day within hour bands.
Station and Trip Activity | Trip volumes by station and trip, assessing the popularity of trips, and the various start and end stations, to assist with bicycle management.
Trip Durations | Number of trips within various trip duration bands
User Information | Reports by user type, gender and age \(where available\)

The program has been designed to be **interactive** allowing users to:
 1. Select the city they want to review,
 2. Filter the data by month, and/or
 3. Filter the data by day of the week.

### Files Used

#### Program Files
The program has been developed in Python, and the logic is contained within bikeshare.py

Users will need to have Python installed to run the program.

#### Data Files
The program uses bike share data provided by [motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/ "motivate website") for the following US cities:
 * Chicago
 * New York city
 * Washington


 > **Note:** The data has not been included as part of this project
 > but must be accessible for the program to run.
